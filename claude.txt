Step 1: Identify Required Data Sources

Determine which ESPN API endpoints contain the statistics you need
Identify what team statistics are available (offensive ratings, defensive ratings, field goal percentages, rebounds, turnovers, pace, etc.)
Determine what game-level data is available (scores, home/away status, dates)
List out all statistics you want to track for correlation analysis

Step 2: Design Your Data Structure

Plan your CSV file structure with columns for: win/loss outcome, team name, opponent name, home/away indicator, date, and all statistical categories
Decide whether you want season averages leading up to each game or specific game statistics
Determine if you'll create one master CSV or separate files per team
Plan how to handle the target variable (win = 1, loss = 0 for easier correlation)

Step 3: Fetch Historical Game Data

Make API requests to get the current season's schedule for all teams
Store game results including dates, opponents, scores, and outcomes
Ensure you have a complete list of all games played so far this season

Step 4: Fetch Team Statistics

For each game in your dataset, collect the team's statistics leading up to that game
Decide on a window: will you use season averages up to that point, last 10 games, or last 5 games?
Collect both the team's own statistics and their opponent's statistics
Include contextual features like home/away, rest days, back-to-back games

Step 5: Build Your Dataset

For each team, create rows where each row represents one game they played
Populate the first column with the outcome (win or loss)
Fill in all statistical columns with the appropriate values from that timepoint
Include both offensive statistics (how the team performs) and defensive statistics (how they defend)
Save to CSV format

Phase 2: Correlation Analysis
Step 6: Prepare Data for Analysis

Load your CSV file into a data analysis structure
Convert categorical variables to numerical (win/loss to 1/0, home/away to 1/0)
Handle any missing data through removal or imputation
Ensure all columns are in the correct numerical format

Step 7: Calculate Correlations for Each Team

For each team's dataset, compute the correlation coefficient between each statistic and the win/loss outcome
Use Pearson correlation or Spearman rank correlation depending on data distribution
Store results showing which statistics have the strongest positive or negative correlation with winning

Step 8: Identify Key Statistics

Rank all statistics by their correlation strength (absolute value)
Identify which statistics are most predictive of wins across all teams
Note if certain statistics are more important for specific teams
Look for unexpected correlations that might provide insights

Step 9: Analyze League-Wide Patterns

Aggregate correlation results across all teams
Identify statistics that consistently correlate with winning across the league
Find statistics that show high variance (important for some teams, not others)
Create a ranked list of the most important predictive features

Phase 3: Team Performance Evaluation
Step 10: Calculate Current Team Performance in Key Statistics

For each team, calculate their current season averages in the high-correlation statistics
Rank teams in each important statistical category
Identify which teams excel or struggle in specific areas
Create team profiles showing strengths and weaknesses

Step 11: Establish League Benchmarks

Calculate league averages for all key statistics
Determine standard deviations to understand what constitutes "good" or "bad" performance
Classify teams as above average, average, or below average in each category
Identify elite performers and struggling teams in each statistical area

Phase 4: Matchup Prediction Framework
Step 12: Design Matchup Comparison System

Create a method to compare two teams' statistics in the most predictive categories
Weight statistics by their correlation strength to wins
Consider both teams' offensive capabilities and defensive capabilities
Factor in home court advantage as a separate variable

Step 13: Build Prediction Logic

For any given matchup, compare Team A's offensive statistics against Team B's defensive statistics
Compare Team B's offensive statistics against Team A's defensive statistics
Calculate an overall score or probability based on the weighted comparisons
Incorporate contextual factors (home/away, recent performance trends, rest days)

Step 14: Create Confidence Metrics

Develop a system to express confidence in predictions
Higher confidence when statistical advantages are clear and consistent
Lower confidence when teams are evenly matched or have contradictory indicators
Use correlation strength as a guide for how much to trust each statistic

Phase 5: Validation & Refinement
Step 15: Backtest Your System

Test your prediction logic on historical games you already have data for
Calculate accuracy rate of predictions
Identify where the system performs well and where it struggles
Look for patterns in incorrect predictions

Step 16: Refine Feature Selection

Based on backtesting, consider removing low-value statistics
Experiment with different weighting schemes for high-correlation stats
Test whether combining statistics creates better predictive power
Consider adding interaction terms (e.g., pace multiplied by shooting percentage)

Step 17: Implement Continuous Updates

Create a system to regularly fetch new game results and statistics
Update your CSV files with new data as games are played
Recalculate correlations periodically to see if patterns shift
Adjust team performance rankings as the season progresses

Phase 6: Output & Usability
Step 18: Design Output Format

Decide how to present predictions (probability percentages, simple win/loss, confidence scores)
Create summary reports showing which team has advantages in which categories
Display key statistics that drive the prediction
Show historical head-to-head performance if available

Step 19: Create Workflow for Making Predictions

Define the steps to input an upcoming matchup
Pull current statistics for both teams
Run comparison through your weighted correlation model
Output prediction with supporting evidence and confidence level

Step 20: Document and Test

Document all assumptions made in your model
Note limitations (doesn't account for injuries, roster changes, motivation factors)
Test with upcoming games and track accuracy over time
Prepare to iterate and improve based on real-world results
